# ETL, Data Analysis, Song Recommendation with Spotify API

## About the project

In this project, I implement an ETL process to pull my previous listening activities data using Spotify API. Then retrieve the data from the database to explore my music listening taste and habits. Moreover, develop a song recommendation system is also a purpose of this project. 

Progress:
